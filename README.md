chivalry-moba
=================

A Chivalry mod.

Kind of like a MOBA, but without almost everything that makes a MOBA a MOBA (i.e. Chivalry with towers and creeps, and maybe archer range modifications), making it some sort of awful TO variant. How long can it possibly take?

This is not endorsed or supported by either Torn Banner or Tom Banner. However, as with the Instagib example mod, feel free to use the code in any other Chivalry mods.

The goal is primarily to make this useful for modders, with examples of:

* A new game mode with unique spawning rules 
* A mode with objectives controlled both by UnrealScript code and the map
* GUI modifications
* New Kismet nodes
* Editor-placeable actors
* Editor map rules
* Slight AI modifications
