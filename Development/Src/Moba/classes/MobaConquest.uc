class MobaConquest extends MobaGame;

/* What makes a "classic" Moba gametype, in addition to what's already in the "generic" type?
 * 1: An HQ that must be destroyed to win
 * 2[1]: Inhibitors, without which super mobs are spawned
 ** [1]: but, this could just be an option of the 'mob spawner' in the level, it's not necessary that it's part of the gametype
 * the rest is mostly just map layout, and sometimes different item and character balancing
